Summoner: The Bescarfed
======================
The epic tale of a humble youth, Young Hero, who must take up the Scarf of Strategically-Limited Power to protect his village from the oncoming hordes of humorously-named monsters, using only the power of his Scarf--and also demons. 

Forsooth this mystical Scarf, bestowed upon our youth by the Village Elder, grants him the power to summon and command various demons through magicks ancient, arcane, and spelled with a "k." 

However! Said magicks are also slowly devouring Young Hero's pure soul probably, so there is a **terrible price to pay!** Bearing the weight of all those demons in the form of one fuzzy muffler will really take its toll on a guy. Luckily, our hero is just the right kind of selfless fellow to lay it all on the line for his beloved village.

Go, now, Young Hero! Battle across the land. Gain priceless skill points. Dominate new demons. And inexplicably start over at Level 1 every time you enter a new region! 

The Village Elder believes in you! (The rest of the village is cautiously optimistic.)

======================
**NOTE**:: This is a super early prototype, not even yet a game.

My original prototype was created using AS3.0 and Flixel.

I am recreating it using Unity for better project management, and to get some experience with C#.

The repo is public because I doubt if my code is going to be top-notch on my first real Unity project -- that is: I wouldn't recommend reading my code if you're looking for best practices. (But if you have suggestions about how I could make my code better, I would certainly love to hear them!)

I'd rather if you didn't use my sprites, but if you do please throw some credit-love my way.
